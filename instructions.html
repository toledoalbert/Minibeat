Chartbeat Front-end Engineering Exercise
---------------------------

Create a web app in the provided file structure that
shows the top ten visited pages for gizmodo.com by title.
Use Chartbeat's realtime data. You can find the API
information in the <a href="http://chartbeat.com/docs/api/explore/">docs</a> (live/toppages/).
The list should be kept up to date in the browser.
When an item in the list is clicked, the right pane
should show its top referers (pages.stats.toprefs).

It should be formatted like the following wireframe.
The page title in the list should be preceded by its
current visitors number (pages.stats.people). The
top referers should be preceded by their visitor
numbers as well.

Guidelines:
- Do not use jQuery or any other frameworks/languages (i.e. use pure JavaScript and CSS).
- We're interested in how you would structure larger codebases.
- Do just enough so we can evaluate your understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- It should work in modern (HTML5) browsers. Focus on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. IE compatibility is nice but don't spend too much time on it.
- Good luck!
